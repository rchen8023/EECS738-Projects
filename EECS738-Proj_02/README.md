# EECS738-Proj_02

In this project, I build a Hidden Markov Model to generate new text and predict next word and sentences with given words.

# Project Instruction

Probabilistic states and transitions

Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
Pick a text corpus dataset such as https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays or from https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets
Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
Formulate ideas on how machine learning can be used to learn word correlations and distributions within the dataset
Build a Hidden Markov Model to be able to programmatically
Generate new text from the text corpus
Perform text prediction given a sequence of words
Document your process and results
Commit your source code, documentation and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

# Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays

# Results

My model is able to predict the next words and generate new text, but some sentence is not make sense, and I think there are still some problem on it, I discussed in the Notebook
